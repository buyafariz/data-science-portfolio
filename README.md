# **Data Science Portfolio**

Hello, and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains a collection of independent projects I have worked on using SQL and Machine Learning. Each project includes data exploration, analysis, and the application of algorithms to extract valuable insights. I hope this repository can be useful for anyone interested in data science, whether for reference or inspiration to develop similar projects.


## **Project List**
ðŸ“š [Books Collection Analysis using SQL](https://github.com/buyafariz/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Books%20Collection%20Analysis%20using%20SQL) â€“ Analyzing book collections using SQL queries to extract insights.  
ðŸŽ¬ [Online Movie Sales Data Analysis using SQL](https://github.com/buyafariz/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Online%20Movie%20Sales%20Data%20Analysis%20using%20SQL) â€“ Exploring and analyzing online movie sales data with SQL.  
ðŸ¥¦ [Vegetable Image Classification using CNN](https://github.com/buyafariz/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Vegetable%20Image%20Classification%20using%20CNN) â€“ Classifying vegetable images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  
ðŸ©¸ [Diagnosis Anemia using SVM and KNN](https://github.com/buyafariz/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Diagnosis%20Anemia%20using%20SVM%20and%20KNN) - Diagnosis anemia using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm.
