# **Books Collection Analysis using SQL**
## Description
A mini project involving data analysis using SQL. The dataset used in this project was specifically generated using AI. The dataset consists of 15 observations and 6 variables. The variables to be analyzed in this project consist of book title, genre, author, publisher, year of publication, and book price. I wrote a more detailed explanation of this project in the following project brief.

## Project Brief
### The Situation:
- A bookstore has a dataset containing information on books sold in the store. The information includes book title, genre, author, publisher, year of publication, and book price.
- Store owners want to better understand their book collections, identify trends, and make better decisions about procuring new books.
- Therefore, he assigned a data analyst to analyze based on the data that the bookstore had.

### The Assignment:
- As a data analyst, you are tasked with analyzing the data in the book tables and providing useful insights to the bookstore.
- You have full access to the book tables and can use SQL queries to extract the information you need.
- You are required to produce a report that summarizes the key findings and provides recommendations based on the data.

### The Objective:
- Objective 1 (Book analysis by price)
- Objective 2 (Author and publisher analysis)
- Objective 3 (Book publication year analysis)
- Objective 4 (Null data detection)
- Objective 5 (Book price analysis)
