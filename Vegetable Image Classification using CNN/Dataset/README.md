# Dataset
This project uses the Vegetable Image Dataset obtained from Kaggle. This dataset contains images of various types of vegetables that are used for training and testing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classification models.
Since the dataset size is quite large, the dataset file is not included in this repository. To use the dataset, you can download it directly through the following link:  
[Vegetable Image Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/misrakahmed/vegetable-image-dataset)  
After downloading the dataset, please save it in the '...Vegetable Images/' folder in this project directory to match the structure used in the code.
